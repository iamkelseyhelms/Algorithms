This readme is for running the brute force (slow), greedy and dynamic programming algorithms written in Python.

Please unzip all the files to the same directory:
coinchange.py
changeslow.py
changegreedy.py
changedp.py
TestSet1.txt
TestSet2.txt

In order to run the algorithms they each need to be called from the command line for instance:
python changeslow.py [Filename].txt

Will use the [filename].txt as the input file, changeslow.py will determine the minimum number of coins required to make change
and also the counts for the types of coints.  The results will be appended to [filename]change.txt

Two sample source files called TestSet1.txt and TestSet2.txt have been included.
